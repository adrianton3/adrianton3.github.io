<h1 id="real-time-differential-growth-in-javascript">Real-time differential growth in JavaScript</h1>
<p>A while ago I made a real time simulation of differential growth, 
and I thought I&#39;d write a bit about its inner workings and what it took 
to make it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/final.png" alt="differential growth">
</p>

<p>The source code is on <a href="https://github.com/adrianton3/differential-growth">github</a>,
and you can see the experiment in action <a href="https://adrianton3.github.io/differential-growth/">here</a>.
It&#39;s written in JavaScript, and uses WebGL and WebWorkers. </p>
<p>I got the idea for the experiment when I saw this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HI8FerKr6Q">video</a>.
The structures in the video all look very interesting and organic. 
I decided to pick one and try to replicate it in real-time. In addition, the
experiment would be available online, and would have some kind of interaction.  </p>
<p>The simplest structures must be variant #2 <em>line expansion</em> at 0:28 and 
variant #6 &quot;directed line expansion&quot;.
Next in terms of complexity seems to be variant #3 <em>planar expansion</em>
at 0:49. The rest seem to work with volumes, which makes both rendering and 
simulating quite hard and computationally intensive.</p>
<p>I thought I&#39;d give directed line expansion (#6) a try.</p>
<p>The people behind the video have a <a href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/?p=6721">website</a>,
with a lot of pictures and other materials which make everything clear. 
The magic blows away when you realize that the simulation is based on a 
finite number of nodes. This means that what you&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t a 
simulation of a continuous body, but rather an agglomeration of many small,
discrete nodes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/wireframe.png" alt="wireframe structure">
</p>

<p>This image is zoomed 4 times. The individual nodes wouldn&#39;t be noticeable
at regular size even with this debug view turned on.</p>
<p>These nodes are called joints in the sourcecode, but here I&#39;ll use nodes and 
joints interchangeably, depending on the context.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the simulation the resulting structure looks very intricate 
and complex, but this emerges from a series of very simple rules. Here are the 
rules that describe the behaviour of the simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>nodes don&#39;t pass through each other</li>
<li>nodes are attracted by their neighbours - they like to hold hands; every node
except for the ones at both ends have 2 neighbours.</li>
<li>nodes don&#39;t like it if their neighbours get too close to each other - nodes 
try to get in line as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-try">First try</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s go though the behavior one more time to see how we go about implementing 
each rule, and how demanding they are computation wise.</p>
<p>For the first rule, to keep joints from stepping on each other we&#39;ll make any 
overlapping joints move away from each other. This means that for every node 
we&#39;d have to check which other nodes it overlaps with. Doing this naively is 
not an option if we want to have more than 100 nodes at a steady 60 fps. 
This rule deserves a longer discussion and I&#39;ll come back to it later.</p>
<p>To make sure joints stay close to their neighbours and don&#39;t wander off,
each one tries to get close to its neighbours. 
The joint will move towards its neighbours by looking at their positions. 
As joints can have at most two neighbours, only two lookups are necessary.</p>
<p>For the final rule, the joint will try to align itself with its neighbours 
by placing itself halfway between them. In order to know where to move it&#39;s 
necessary to lookup the neighbours&#39; positions again.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the last two rules move the joint in the same direction.
The drawing below illustrate rule 2 and 3, respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/rule2.png" alt="rule-2">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/rule3.png" alt="rule-3">
</p>

<p>Getting back to the first rule about overlapping nodes, we need to figure out 
what data structure to store the nodes in.
It&#39;s clear that an array that we iterate for each node is not going to cut it -
it is however the simplest to implement.
The best suited structure I can think of is a grid of buckets. Our use case 
favours this even more since the nodes are all of the same size.</p>
<p>If the buckets have the same width and height as the nodes&#39; diameter, then 
building the grid should take linear time. Checking if a node overlaps 
another should take constant time as any node can occupy at most 4 buckets.
Overall, applying the overlapping rule to all nodes takes linear time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/grid-o-buckets.png" alt="grid-o-buckets">
</p>

<p>Take, for example, the blue node in the figure above. To find out which nodes 
overlap it, we only need to check the buckets that the node covers.</p>
<p>The solution thus far seems more than adequate. I&#39;ve run some benchmarks that
confirm this - the time increases linearly with the number of nodes. </p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/linear-buckets.png" alt="linear time">
</p>

<p>Although I had optimized the simulation, the experiment was still rather slow.
After doing some profiling, I noticed that the bottleneck seemed to be drawing 
on the canvas.</p>
<h2 id="two-threads">Two threads</h2>
<p>One easy way to make the experiment faster is to use multiple threads. There are 
two processes which can run in parallel - the simulation and the rendering.
Moreover, the rendering has hard deadlines, while the simulation 
doesn&#39;t - it only has to have a certain throughput. Now the simulation thread 
can produce frames in advance and store them in a buffer for the rendering 
thread to consume.</p>
<p>Garbage collection spikes will happen sooner or later, but now that we have the 
buffer, they shouldn&#39;t incur any delays, unless we have many consecutive spikes. </p>
<p>Because of the buffer, any interaction with the experiment will be delayed by as
many frames as can fit in the buffer. This is why it&#39;s best to limit the buffer,
so that the delay isn&#39;t too high.</p>
<p>At the same time, I managed to completely separate simulation code from 
rendering code and I started running benchmarks and doing profiling of the 
simulation by itself. I didn&#39;t expect <em>forEach</em>, <em>native Sets</em> and even 
<em>for ... of</em> to show up in the profiles, but they sure did. In the end 
I used plain old <em>for</em> loops and arrays. I&#39;m not a fan of micro-optimizations, 
but they payed off in this case.</p>
<h2 id="better-renderer">Better renderer</h2>
<p>The canvas renderer proved to be too slow - the alternative is a WebGL-based 
one. There are several mature WebGL renderers out there, and the one I&#39;m most 
familiar with <a href="https://github.com/GooTechnologies/goojs">GooJS</a>. 
I&#39;ve worked on it for more than two years and I know it inside out. 
However, goo is a big-ish 3d entity-component game engine 
while what I need is just something to render sprites and apply some 
post processing.</p>
<p>I ultimately went with <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/">PixiJS</a> as it&#39;s a small 
2d renderer that supports sprite batching out of the box. Why are sprites 
important? Because I&#39;m going to draw one for each node and with a bit of 
post-processing it should look similar to what it used to under the old 
renderer.</p>
<p>The sprites are radial gradients over the alpha channel. When they overlap
they add up to form a fuzzy shoelace of sorts. We can feed this fuzzy image
to a step filter and obtain something akin to the image below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/2-f44ddbf.png" alt="rough lumpy">
</p>

<p>This looks kind of rough and lumpy - you can tell it&#39;s made up of blobs
especially when you see it in motion. By adding extra &quot;dummy&quot; sprites
between joints we obtain a more continuous aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/4-2a89afc.png" alt="smooth continuous">
</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like the structure to have some life in it - the original one
cycles colors as if it has some kind of vascular system. I&#39;d like to replicate
that by slightly tinting the otherwise color-less gradients I&#39;ve been using.</p>
<p>For rendering the joints I used pixi&#39;s 
<a href="http://pixijs.download/release/docs/PIXI.particles.ParticleContainer.html">particle container</a>, 
which is advertised as <em>a really fast version of the Container built solely
for speed</em>. However, it doesn&#39;t support tinting which I need in order to 
give the structure its gradient.
What it does have instead is per particle alpha value. I hacked the shader
and used this alpha attribute to interpolate between the two colors of my experiment.
I have hardcoded the colors into the pixi shader but that seems the only way.
It would have been nice if pixi allowed some ways of extending their particle
shader.</p>
<p>The end result with flat coloring looks like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/5-c6d59ee.png" alt="flat-colored">
</p>

<p>While implementing this I made a really pretty bug. Unfortunately,
the bug isn&#39;t preserved as a commit - all I have is this image.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/pretty-bug.png" alt="bug picture">
</p>


<h2 id="more-graphics">More graphics</h2>
<p>Next, I started to fiddle with the graphics - I chose to try out a less flat 
look. One of my gripes with the experiment at this stage was that when two 
unrelated joints are too close, they tend to look as if they&#39;re merging. 
To make the gap between joints more visible, I added ambient occlusion 
as a filter. In the same filter I also added basic lighting. The normals
to the surface can be calculated the same way AO was calculated - by 
looking up the value of adjacent texels in the initial render.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="../../static/differential-growth/7-9af02e7.png" alt="AO and basic lighting">
</p>

<p>Now that we have lighting, an easy way to get more interactivity is to make
the light follow the cursor. 
Light calculations are performed entirely on the rendering thread, which means
there is no delay, unlike in the interaction with the structure itself.
This makes the entire experiment feel responsive.</p>
<p>The experiment looked all right at this point, it even runs ok on my 4-year-old 
laptop with integrated graphics, so I decided to wrap it up and submit it to
Chrome Experiments. </p>
<h2 id="afterthoughts">Afterthoughts</h2>
<h3 id="the-google-closure-compiler">The Google closure compiler</h3>
<p>Several months after releasing, I realized that there are many 
micro-optimizations and inlining that can be done on the code, all of which can
be done automatically. I was hoping the Google closure compiler could do that, 
so I don&#39;t have to do it manually. If I just fed the initial code, I didn&#39;t get
any meaningful speedup, as the compiler couldn&#39;t infer types. What&#39;s more, from
early stages I had to make sure that certain properties that are used outside 
of the optimised code were not mangled. I therefore had to rewrite every 
<code>joint.position</code> as <code>joint[&#39;position&#39;]</code>, for example. </p>
<p>I proceeded to add types annotations in the entire code. I also tried to put 
everything in the same scope. Another thing I tried was to make the code more
class-based, thinking that the compiler might like it more.
After all these changes, and some manual inlining in critical parts, the most I 
could squeeze was a 20% speed-up.</p>
<p>Take the following snippet, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-comment">/** @typedef {{ x: number, y: number }} */</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> V2

<span class="hljs-comment">/** @type {{ make: function(number, number): V2, add: function(V2, V2): V2 }} */</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Vec2 = (() =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> /** <span class="hljs-title">V2</span> */ <span class="hljs-title">make</span> <span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-comment">/** number */</span>x, <span class="hljs-comment">/** number */</span>y)</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> { x, y }
    }

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> /** <span class="hljs-title">V2</span> */ <span class="hljs-title">add</span> <span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-comment">/** V2 */</span>a, <span class="hljs-comment">/** V2 */</span>b)</span> </span>{
        a.x += b.x
        a.y += b.y
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> { make, add }
})();


(() =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> { make, add } = Vec2

    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> v = add(make(<span class="hljs-number">11</span>, <span class="hljs-number">22</span>), make(<span class="hljs-number">33</span>, <span class="hljs-number">44</span>))
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(v)
})()
</code></pre>
<p>The only thing the closure compiler manages to do is minify it, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-pi">'use strict'</span>;<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c = {a:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(a, b)</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {x:a, y:b};
}, add:<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(a, b)</span> </span>{
  a.x += b.x;
  a.y += b.y;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a;
}}, d = c.a, e = c.add, f = e(d(<span class="hljs-number">11</span>, <span class="hljs-number">22</span>), d(<span class="hljs-number">33</span>, <span class="hljs-number">44</span>));
<span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(f);
</code></pre>
<p>However, the code can entirely be resolved at compile time - the whole program 
can be reduced to <code>console.log({ x: 44, y: 66 })</code>.
What&#39;s more is that I had to fully type the whole thing. I have to
write types twice if I plan to namespace my functions like that.</p>
<p>The most annoying thing is that the most optimised version of the code on 
Chrome manages to be 84% slower on Firefox. Optimisations usually result in 
speed-ups in both Chrome and Firefox, but I managed to somehow hit Firefox&#39;s
heuristics in a bad way. I chose to stop the optimisation process here, 
because it started feeling like a shamanic process.</p>
<h3 id="try-a-different-data-structure">Try a different data structure</h3>
<p>There was an alternative data structure that I could have used for the 
simulation, namely a plain array, where the joints are sorted on the x-axis.  </p>
<p>Sorting can take up to <em>n log n</em> - but maybe we can pull it off in linear 
time as the array is always in a mostly sorted state. </p>
<p>If we want to find out what nodes overlap a given node we have to check only 
the nodes that are positioned at most one diameter away. This should be a 
cheap operation given that the nodes are sorted. </p>
<p>How many nodes can we possibly inspect for overlap?
The worst case scenario happens at the end of the simulation when the space 
is almost full. At this point there are roughly <em>sqrt n</em> nodes that need to
be verified for each overlapping test. This raises the running time 
to <em>n sqrt n</em>. The approach might still be interesting if the constant factors
in the grid of buckets are too high.</p>
<h3 id="other-ideas">Other ideas</h3>
<p>Using a real physics engine might be faster, because they&#39;re using more
specialized data structures. On the other hand, it might be slower because
they&#39;re trying to be physically accurate.</p>
<p>Another option would be to render the joints using <em>GL_POINTS</em>. All the
information necessary to render a joint (position, radius, tint) can fit in
a single 4-component attribute.</p>
<p>Yet another option would be to break up the simulation on multiple threads.
They would, however, be hard to synchronise - if any one of the threads is late,
then the whole frame is incomplete. The more threads we use, the higher the
probability that at least one of them will be late. Moreover, frame buffers
would also be very hard to maintain.</p>
